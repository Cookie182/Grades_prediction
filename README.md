# University DBMS Project to help store and predict grades
### Using Python to generate mock data depending on each subjects structure and making models to help get them ready to start predicting 2 aspescts of a students per subject.
* The probability of the student passing as they complete each assessment
* The predicted end overall grade of that subject as students complete aech assessment

### There are four files that contain my way of trying to figure out ways to generate mock data and to find the best models for predicting grades. Training data was generated with using a range of numbers (depending on a particular subjects structure) that has a Gaussian weight distribution attached to it 

* ### [Demo](https://github.com/Cookie182/Grades_prediction/blob/main/demo.py "Final version of the CLI demo") - *Final version of the CLI demo using the code that was written previously in all the files, except it is slightly more organised here. More functionality options were also added.*

* ### [Guide](https://github.com/Cookie182/Grades_prediction/blob/main/Guide.ipynb "Guide to the demo.py file") - *Simple guide to go through parts of the demo.py script*
